## 🎯 Why I Built This

This project simulates a real-time data pipeline designed to track **Anthony Edwards’ performance during the NBA Playoffs**, specifically as he leads the Minnesota Timberwolves through the Western Conference Finals for 2 years straight. His Growth is legendary, knocking out the GOAT's like Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and recently Steph Curry (even though he was injured).

As a former pro basketball player and aspiring data engineer, I'm passionate about building sports-related data systems that mirror what companies like **FanDuel, PrizePicks, DraftKings, NBA, and ESPN** use in production.

## 🚀 Live App

[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://anthony-edwards-pipeline-by-mt.streamlit.app/)

This app is built with Python, DuckDB, and Streamlit to track Anthony Edwards' game performance — including playoffs!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This end-to-end pipeline:
- Ingests live NBA data using the `nba_api`
- Cleans and transforms the data with Python (`pandas`)
- Stores analytics-ready data in a local warehouse (`DuckDB`)
- Visualizes player performance with an interactive dashboard (`Streamlit`)
- Can be extended for real-time betting, fantasy, or team analytics use cases

> This is not just a portfolio piece—it's a reflection of how I see data and sports coming together in real-world systems.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- **Real-Time Data Fetching:** Scheduling and testing live data pulls using Python required learning how to handle API timeouts and failures.

- **Building with DuckDB:** As a new tool for me, DuckDB’s in-memory SQL processing was powerful but had a learning curve around file storage and schema behavior.

- **Automating the Pipeline:** Implementing clean orchestration logic using Python functions and script separation taught me how to write scalable code.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer             | Tools Used                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Ingestion        | `nba_api`                        |
| Transformation   | `pandas`, `python`               |
| Data Storage     | `DuckDB` (lightweight SQL DB)    |
| Visualization    | `Streamlit`                      |
| Automation Ready | `Manual Trigger Playoffs Only`   |
| Version Control  | `Git + GitHub`                   |
